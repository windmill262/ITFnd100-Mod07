### Introduction
In this document I will be discussing when to use SQL User Defined Funcitons (UDF) and explain the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions. 

##When to use a SQL User Defined Function (UDF)
A SQL UDF can be used when you would like to pass a parameter (fig.1) to return a value or perform
complex calculations. The function can be saved in the database and be called upon when needed as 
opposed to having to create the task when needed. (external source: https://www.tutorialgateway.org/user-defined-functions-in-sql/, 2021)
